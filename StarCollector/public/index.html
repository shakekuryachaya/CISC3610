    <p>COIN COLLECTOR PHASER GAME<p>
    <p>Shake Kuryachaya<p>
      <p>Jonny must collect all of the stars in order to go back home. If he collects all of them, he will earn 150 points and earn his ticket back to Earth. Although it might look like he is already on Earth, he is actually a real human stuck in a body of a highly pixilated character who looks exactly like him. Jonny doesn't know how he got to this world but he sure does not want to stay here! SO, COLLECT!<p>
