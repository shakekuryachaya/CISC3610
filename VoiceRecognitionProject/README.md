#4 - voice recognition project

Speech project will not work on your computer by opening up the file in your web browser. You will need to upload to a web server, or use NetBeans Connector for Chrome to view locally.

Use the Chrome browser for this lab.

Common objects were found, as it will help with the voice recognition.

Use Text to Speech to have the program speak back to the user.

When the user presses the Speak button, have the program listen and stop when the user stops speaking (which is automatic) or if they press "Stop".
