#Audio Lab

Use the following site to help you with this lab.

Have 5 buttons (or more) to make a music/sound effect machine. Have a series of buttons that are labeled. They should play a sound when clicked.

Try to make a box or something that holds the buttons, so to looks like a sound machine. You are welcomed to use an Image Map tool to place links on an image (of a sound machine) if you want it to look more realistic. Here is how Images Maps work. Even use Cool Text to make fancy text if you like.
