#Video Lab

Find 3 videos on YouTube, then Share them by selecting to Embed. You will get some HTML Code. This code will give you a web page containing the video. It uses an iframe.

Make a page containing the videos. Include on the page, some information about the videos.

If have been wanting to create your own videos for YouTube, this would be something interesting to do. Screencastiy allows you to make training videos, if you are curious. But for the assignment, using someone elses video is largely what I was expecting.
