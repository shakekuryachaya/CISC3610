Make an animation using a numbers sprite sheet

Using a sprite sheet of numbers, have the program count from 0 to 10, at time increments of 500 ms. Program starts by having the number 0 displayed and then starts animating (500 ms increments) when the user presses an HTML button that is labled start. Stopping when the number 10 is reached.

Please be sure and center the numbers on the canvas. For the 10, it must be using a 1 and a 0 image from the sprite sheet, not a single 10 image.

Set the canvas size to the width of the number 10 from your images. Draw a background color, to make the canvas stand out from the page background.
