#Lab Resume
Use BootStrap (or similar framework)

Post a resume for yourself, or if you do not want to post a resume, post a resume of some TV character that you like (such as for Bart Simpson).

Ideally it would have a naviagation bar. Rather than having your resume read like a page, break the sections using the Navbar.

Some "Portfolio" feature showcasing some interesting projects. Such as the Data Visualization project perhaps. Something that would look impressive.

Carousel is useful to showcase various items.
