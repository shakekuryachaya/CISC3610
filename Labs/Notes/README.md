#Notes Lab
You might have to save the file to a server rather than running from localhost for this page to get localStorage to work.

Have a simple form for the the user to store their notes.
Create an input box (of 40 characters) to allow the user to title their notes
Create a textarea (10 rows, 80 columns) ) to let the user write some text.
As the user is writing the text (onInput) save the text value to the localStorage.
If the user comes back to the page, restore the text back in the form, so that the user can resume their information.
Offer a button called Clear
Clear erases the text in the whole form and therefore in the localStorage.
